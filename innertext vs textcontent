The `innerText` and `textContent` properties in JavaScript are used to get or set the text inside an HTML element, but they have key differences in how they work.

### Key Differences Between `innerText` and `textContent`:

1. **Rendering and Styling:**
   - **`innerText`:**  
     - `innerText` takes into account the **rendered** text, meaning it only returns the visible text as displayed on the page, after considering CSS styling (like `display: none` or `visibility: hidden`).
     - It **triggers a reflow** (recalculating the layout) when accessed, which can make it slightly slower.
     - **Newline characters** and whitespace are **adjusted** based on the visible formatting. For example, `innerText` respects line breaks (`<br>`) and ignores hidden text.
   
   - **`textContent`:**  
     - `textContent` returns **all** the text content of an element, including text hidden with `display: none`, `visibility: hidden`, or text from hidden child elements.
     - It **does not consider the styles** of the element and simply gives the raw text inside the element, including whitespace and newlines exactly as they appear in the HTML code.
     - `textContent` is typically faster than `innerText` because it does not require recalculating layout or rendering.

2. **Whitespace Handling:**
   - **`innerText`:**  
     - Adjusts whitespace and may collapse multiple spaces into a single space.
     - It also **preserves the text's visible formatting**, like spacing, newlines, and breaks.
   
   - **`textContent`:**  
     - Does **not adjust whitespace** and returns it exactly as it appears in the HTML source code, including all spaces, tabs, and newlines.

3. **Performance:**
   - **`innerText`:**  
     - It is generally **slower** because it needs to calculate the layout and style of the element to get the rendered text.
   
   - **`textContent`:**  
     - It is typically **faster** since it doesn't require layout recalculation and only returns the raw text.

4. **Browser Support and Use Cases:**
   - **`innerText`:**  
     - `innerText` is supported in most modern browsers but was **originally specific to Internet Explorer**. It’s more suited for cases where you need to access or modify the visible, rendered text.
   
   - **`textContent`:**  
     - `textContent` is a standard property and works in all browsers, including Internet Explorer 9 and later. It’s generally the more reliable and recommended choice when working with raw text content.

### Examples to Illustrate the Differences

#### Example 1: Whitespace and Styling Differences
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>innerText vs textContent</title>
</head>
<body>
    <div id="example">
        This is some text.
        <span style="display: none;">This is hidden text.</span>
        <p>Another paragraph.</p>
    </div>

    <script>
        let exampleElement = document.getElementById("example");

        console.log("innerText: ", exampleElement.innerText);
        console.log("textContent: ", exampleElement.textContent);
    </script>
</body>
</html>
```

#### Output:
```javascript
innerText:  This is some text.
Another paragraph.
textContent:  This is some text.
This is hidden text.
Another paragraph.
```

- `innerText` excludes the hidden text (the span with `display: none`).
- `textContent` includes everything, including the hidden text.

#### Example 2: Whitespace Handling
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Whitespace Handling</title>
</head>
<body>
    <div id="example">
        This     is      some    text.
    </div>

    <script>
        let exampleElement = document.getElementById("example");

        console.log("innerText: ", exampleElement.innerText); // Adjusted spaces
        console.log("textContent: ", exampleElement.textContent); // Raw spaces
    </script>
</body>
</html>
```

#### Output:
```javascript
innerText:  This is some text.
textContent:  This     is      some    text.
```

- `innerText` collapses and adjusts the spaces, while `textContent` preserves the exact spacing.

### When to Use Which?
- **Use `textContent`** when:
  - You need the **raw text content** of an element.
  - You don't care about hidden text or styling.
  - You want better **performance**.
  
- **Use `innerText`** when:
  - You need to work with **visible text** as it appears on the page (taking into account CSS).
  - You want to preserve the appearance of text, including spaces and line breaks based on the browser rendering.

In general, **`textContent`** is recommended in most cases due to its reliability and better performance. Use **`innerText`** when working with **rendered text** that may be affected by CSS styles.
